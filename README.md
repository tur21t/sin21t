This is a simple JavaScript-based piano app that uses keyboard input or mouse clicks to play the notes of a piano.

The app has a set of white and black keys. When a key is pressed or clicked, a corresponding note is played. 
The app is also connected to a display, which will show the frequency and note name of the note being played.
